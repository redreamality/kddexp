\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We studied the problem of explaining the relationship between two Wikipedia pages that are hyperlinked. 
If there exists a SPO triple explicitly explaining the relationship, this problem degenerates to the retrieval of such triple. 
However, we found such case is extremely rare, 1.5\%, and thus increasing recall for the rest pairs is crucial. We proposed to use concept pairs as intermediate variables to find a typical attribute for this pair as a possible explanation. We observed that, to ensure accuracy, such conceptualization should jointly optimize for both entities and identify head concepts. We validated our framework using real-life Wikipedia entities and taxonomies.
