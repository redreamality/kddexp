\subsection{Head Concept Vs Original Concept}

\subsection{Find alias}
\subsubsection{compare}

Compare $ P((\gamma_{1i},\gamma_{2i} |a ))P(\gamma_{1i}|a) \times P(\gamma_{2i}|a)$


\subsubsection{Sense Disambiguation}
We can solve the problem of sense disambiguation problem well by applying this method since there are many entities belongs to the same concept and we only consider topK $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ pairs that has high typicality $P( (\gamma_1,\gamma_2) |a)$, so that the weird $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ patterns as manifest in Example.~\ref{exa:sd} can be easily filtered.
