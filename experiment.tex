\subsubsection{Sense Disambiguation}

We can solve the problem of sense disambiguation problem well by applying this method since there are many entities belongs to the same concept and we only consider topK $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ pairs that has high typicality $P( (\gamma_1,\gamma_2) |a)$, so that the weird $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ patterns as manifest in Example.~\ref{exa:sd} can be easily filtered.

\begin{example}[Sense Disambiguation]
Consider the following $(e1,a,e2)$ tuple \term{(iphone, manufacturer, apple)}. Suppose it is our query, where \term{apple}'s sense can either be a kind of \term{fruit} or a \term{company}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:evplot} is a heatmap for all the concepts pairs $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ of attributes \term{manufacturer}. The horizontal axis represents the $e_1$ and the vertical axis stands for $e_2$. The darker the blue is, the higher typicality it will be. In Fig.~\ref{fig:evplot}, We can observe that the top concepts of $e_2$ in the heatmap are \term{company, manufacturer,...} and top 10 pairs also does not include \term{fruit}. The intuition for this is that there exists thousands of $(e1,a,e2)$ tuple such as \term{(BMW\_Z4,manufacturer,BMW),(PlayStation\_4,manufacturer,Sony)} other than \term{(iphone, manufacturer, apple)} tuple, which results in a reasonable distribution.
