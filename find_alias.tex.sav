For a pair \term{(Sherlock holmes, United Kindom)}, \term{country} is a merely-ok attribute, on the contrary, \term{residence, deathPlace} are better since they are more specific and more seemingly plausible to be an attribute.We argue that for each pair of entity, there is a selectional preference for attribute.

\subsection{Problem Definition}
Given a set of concept pairs ($\gamma_1$,$\gamma_2$), where $\gamma_1\in C_1$ and $\gamma_2\in C_2$, we want to find a set of attributes A, where for each $a \in A$:
we can form a ($\gamma_1$,$a$,$\gamma_2$) pair which best describe the relationship between $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$.

\subsection{Problem Solution}

\subsubsection{Entity Attribute Graph Construction}

For any $(entity_1, attribute, entity_2)$ tuple, later denoted as  $(e_1, a, e_2)$ , where $e_1$ and $e_2$ are also referred to as \term{domain} and \term{range} of the attribute. We can conceptualize $e_1$ and $e_2$ using the method in section~\ref{sec:conceptualization}, and get a set of concept $C_1,C_2$, accompanied with a set of probabilities $P(\gamma_{1}|e_{1i})$, $P(\gamma_{2}|e_2)$,where ${\gamma_{1} \in C_1},{\gamma_{2} \in C_2}$.

To construct the Entity Attribute Graph, we only need topK concepts to form $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ pair, K trough case study is around 5, so we here set K=10.

Thus for any attribute $a$, given a pair of entity $(e_{1i},e_{2j})$, we can define:
\xch{should i use joint ratio here?}

\begin{equation} \begin{split} P_{(e_{1i},e_{2j})}((\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}) |a)&=P_{before}(\gamma_1|a) \times P_{after}(\gamma_2|a) \\&=  P(\gamma_{1}|e_{1i}) P(e_{1i}|a) \times P(\gamma_{2}|e_{2j})P(e_{2j}|a) \end{split} \label{eq:giga}\end{equation}


where we use $P_{(e_{1i},e_{2j})}((\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}) |a)$ to denote observing a single pair $(e_{1i},e_{2j})$, how likely is a combination of $(\gamma_{1},a,\gamma_{2})$ to occur.

Consequently,
\begin{equation} P((\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}) |a)=\sum_{  e_{1i} \in E_1 ,e_{2j} \in E_2} P_{(e_{1i},e_{2j})}((\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}) |a) \label{eq:pg1g2ga}\end{equation}

where $E_1,E_2$ denoting the whole set of domain entity and range entity,The  $P(e_{1i}|a)$ and $P(e_{2j}|a)$ here has only 2 values $1$ and  $0$, depending on whether  $e_1$ occurs before $a$ or $e_2$ occurs after $a$. Apparently, only $(e_{1i}, a, e_{2j})$ occurs will give the equation a non-zero value, therefore, Eq.~\ref{eq:pg1g2ga} is finally equal to Eq.~\ref{eq:gga_fin}.

\begin{equation} \begin{split} P((\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}) |a) &= \sum_{  (e_{1i},a,e_{2j})\in KB } P_{(e_{1i},e_{2j})}((\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}) |a) \\&=  \sum_{  (e_{1i},a,e_{2j})\in KB }P(\gamma_{1}|e_{1i}) \times P(\gamma_{2}|e_{2j})\end{split} \label{eq:gga_fin}\end{equation}

As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:bipartite}, the process of calculating $P((\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}) |a)$ is as follows\term{}

To Construct the Entity Attribute Graph, we calculate $P((\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}) |a)$ for each attribute.




Note that we only consider the attributes whose range is an entity, and ignore those numerical values or date-and-time values such as $( Mona Lisa, Year, 1503)$.





For each $(\gamma_{1},a,\gamma_{2})$ tuple, we can calculate $P((\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}) |a)$ for each

\subsection{Find the best alias}

We then Use an $\argmax$ model to solve the problem.

Given $(e_1,e_2)$, our goal is to find the best attribute for it. We denote it as:
$$\argmax P((e_1,e_2)|a)$$
