\section{Framework}

In this section, we present the problem and our solution to it.

\subsection{Problem Definition}


First,we do conceptualization

Next,Judge whether the 2 entities are conceptually same

Then, there are 2 cases of the CanBeExplained function:

\begin{itemize}
\item Explain 2 conceptually similar entity

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption{conceptually similar entity}
    \begin{tabular}{rr}
    \toprule
    entity & concept \\
    \midrule
    Steve jobs & Person \\
    Bill Gates & Person \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}%
  \label{tab:addlabel}%
\end{table}%


\item Explain 2 conceptually different entity
% Table generated by Excel2LaTeX from sheet 'Sheet1'
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption{Add caption}
    \begin{tabular}{rr}
    \toprule
    entity & concept \\
    \midrule
    Mona Lisa & Painting \\
    Renaissance & Period \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}%
  \label{tab:addlabel}%
\end{table}%

Note that the concept here are not unique.

\end{itemize}


Last, We rank all the explanations in each step.
